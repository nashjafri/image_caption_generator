# image_caption_generator
Project completed as part of the Erd≈ës Deep Learning Bootcamp (Fall 2025). Builds an image captioning system from scratch, starting with Flickr8k dataset and scaling to Flickr30k and MS COCO. Implements CNN+LSTM encoder-decoder baseline and Transformer-based models, evaluated with CIDEr, SPICE, BLEU, METEOR, CLIPScore, and BERTScore.
